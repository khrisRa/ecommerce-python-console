# ecommerce-python-console
Simple console ecommerce application for a retail store
1. If using pycharm to run the program, please configure your interpreter, you may use system interpreter python 3 and above (3.10 is being used).
2. To run the application on windows with python already installed run or double click the “ecom.py” python file.
3. Other python files are function library that I created to improve the coding efficiency.
4. A python file is avalaible in the dbscript folder which will populate some data in the database initially when run, make sure that the ecom.py file is run beforehand.
5. Thank you.
