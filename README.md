1. If using pycharm to run the program, please configure your interpreter, you may use system interpreter python 3 and above (3.10 is being used).
2. To run the application on windows with python already installed run or double click the “ecom.py” python file.
3. Other python files are function library that I created to improve the coding efficiency.
4. There is a document in the folder explaining the application flow under the name of “Application flow_and_test case.pdf”
5. A python file is avalaible in the dbscript folder which will populate some data in the database initially when run, make sure that the ecom.py file is run beforehand if you  are downloading the code from the github.
6. The following link leads to a video describing a walkthrough of the system. https://youtu.be/urnvH8mgWEA
